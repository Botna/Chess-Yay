# Chess-Yay
Android Program


This is my first attempt at android programming, basing the gameplay rules off of Chess 2.0 (C) David Sirlin (http://www.sirlingames.com/products/chess-2-print-and-play) 

Work in progress...thus far, this game has been designed with people who are knowledgable about the ins and outs of the rules, so it is not super beginner friendly.  Please take a moment to visit the link above to download the official rules.

If you would like to test this program out, please click the below link and install that APK file to your Android device https://github.com/Botna/outputs/blob/master/apk/app-debug-unaligned.apk?raw=true

You will need to enter a username and password of your choosing, click register to create it, and it will log in.  Afterwards clikc campaigns-> the little plus -> invite by name  and type my name (andrew) in all lower case to send me an invite! Choose your class, and let the games begin!

The method by which invites are sent is currently very rough, but anyone else that downloads and registers an account is capable of playing games in the above way, either with myself or any other user. (User list coming soon!)
